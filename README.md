## How Does It Work?

In contrast to [spigot-dockerized](https://github.com/zekroTJA/spigot-dockerized), where the pre-built spigot binary is already compiled on image built, this image downloads the latest BuildToos from spigot's Jenkins server and build the latest version of spigot directly on startup. Because building the `spigot.jar` can take up to several minutes *(depending on system resources ofc)*, each start of the server may take significantly longer than a normal dry start.

## How To Use

You can pull the image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zekro/spigot-autobuild) or [build it yourself](#build-it-yourself).

```
$ docker pull zekro/spigot-autobuild:latest
```

Then, run the image mounting below container directories to your host system for persistent data, bind the ports and set preferences with environment variables: 

```
$ docker run \
    -p 25565:25565 -p 25575:25575 \
    -v /home/mc/config:/etc/mcserver/config \
    -v /home/mc/plugins:/etc/mcserver/plugins \
    -v /home/mc/worlds:/etc/mcserver/worlds \
    -v /home/mc/locals:/etc/mcserver/locals \
    -e MC_VERSION=1.14.3 \
    -e BUILD_CACHING=true \
    -e XMS=2G \
    -e XMX=4G \
    -d \
    spigot-autobuild:latest
```

Or, if you are using docker-compose:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  #...
  spigot:
    image: 'zekro/spigot-autobuild:latest'
    restart: always
    environment:
      - 'MC_VERSION=1.14.3'
      - 'BUILD_CACHING=true'
      - 'XMS=2G'
      - 'XMX=4G'
    ports:
      - '25565:25565'
      - '25575:25575'
    volumes:
      - './spigot/config:/etc/mcserver/config'
      - './spigot/plugins:/etc/mcserver/plugins'
      - './spigot/worlds:/etc/mcserver/worlds'
      - './spigot/locals:/etc/mcserver/locals'

```

## Build Caching?

Defaultly, `BUILD_CACHING` is enabled which builds the `spigot.jar` on first startup and saves the commit hash of this build in a save file inside the container. Next time you start the container, the saved hash will be compared with the has of the latest available version. Only if they differ, a new build will be started. Else, the previously built `spigot.jar` inside the container will be used.

## Build It Yourself

Build the image yourself by cloning this repository and build the image with `docker build`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zekroTJA/spigot-autobuild --branch master --depth 1
$ cd spigot-autobuild
$ docker build . -t zekro/spigot-autobuild:latest
```

## RCON CLI

Included in the image, there is a RCON cli client which you can use to connect to the servers console or execute server commands from outside the container.

This image uses [itzg's rcon-cli](https://github.com/itzg/rcon-cli). Please take a look at his repository and give him a star for this wonderful project. ;)

Commands can be executed as following:
```
# docker exec <container> rcon --port 25575 --password <rcon_pw> <server_command>
```
*Of course, you need to configure the RCON server in your `server.properties` before.*

If you need further information about how to use the rcon-cli, please take a look at the [official documentation](https://github.com/itzg/rcon-cli#usage) of this tool.
